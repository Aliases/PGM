# Structured Prediction for Dialogue Classification

In this project, we perform classification of dialogues in conversation snippets. We have compared different approaches including Independent approaches like Bag-of-Words (TF-IDF), Random Forest, etc. and structured approaches like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). The task was to classify dialogue in 4 categories, Inform, Question, Directive and Commissive.
